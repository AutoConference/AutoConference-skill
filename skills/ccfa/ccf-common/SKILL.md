# CCF Common

## Core Rule

This is the shared control module for the CCFA Skills family. Do not use it as a user-facing research assistant module. Use it to keep routing, handoff behavior, source provenance, private-material handling, and score-risk language consistent across `ccf-*` skills and `ccf-skill-forger`.

## Invocation Controls

**CCFA Handoff Mode: PARTIAL (Recommended).** Follow `metadata.ccf_skill_controls.handoff_question_mode` and `references/handoff-modes.md`. This skill provides shared policy only; route ordinary research tasks to the owning skill in `references/routing.md`.

## Shared Controls

Load only the file needed for the current maintenance task:

- `references/routing.md`: Use to resolve which CCFA skill owns a request and to avoid trigger overlap.
- `references/task-modes.md`: Use to interpret quick and standard execution modes across CCFA skills.
- `references/review-output-standards.md`: Use to keep numeric scoring, multi-reviewer panels, score-change conditions, and visible output quality consistent.
- `references/handoff-modes.md`: Use to interpret `metadata.ccf_skill_controls.handoff_question_mode`.
- `references/privacy-and-evidence.md`: Use when handling manuscripts, reviews, rebuttals, private drafts, literature searches, or evidence claims.
- `references/source-registry.yaml`: Use as the shared source inventory for venue rules, review methods, exemplar records, and research-workflow references.
- `references/ccf-a-venue-map.md`: Use when a non-writing skill needs venue-family mapping without depending on `ccf-paper-writer`.
- `references/skill-trigger-registry.yaml`: Use as the v0.4 public trigger registry for routing conflict audits.
- `references/artifact-contracts.md`: Use whenever a skill creates or revises files; it defines ownership, canonical paths, overwrite-in-place defaults, and the narrow cases that require retained history.
- `references/ccfa-yaml-contract.md`: Use for the shared `ccfa.yaml` project-state schema.

## Maintenance Workflow

1. When editing any CCFA family skill, preserve the `metadata.ccf_skill_controls` block and keep its keys aligned with `references/handoff-modes.md`.
2. Use `references/routing.md` before adding new trigger language to prevent overlapping ownership.
3. Use `references/task-modes.md` before changing checklist strictness, quick polishing, standard review, or output contracts.
4. Use `references/review-output-standards.md` before changing scorecards, reviewer panels, score-risk language, or final output self-check rules.
5. Use `references/privacy-and-evidence.md` before adding any browsing, citation, novelty, scoring, experiment-result, compression, or rebuttal instruction.
6. Use `references/artifact-contracts.md` before changing generated filenames, revision behavior, report folders, caches, attempt archives, or ledgers. Default to one canonical artifact per deliverable and update it in place.
7. Never commit personal absolute paths, usernames, expanded home directories, private local skill roots, or machine-specific command examples. Use `$CODEX_HOME`, `$HOME`, repo-relative paths, or non-identifying placeholders.
8. Put new public sources in `references/source-registry.yaml`; do not duplicate long URL lists in sibling `source-notes.md` files. Local references must use repo-relative or non-identifying `local:`/`repo:` identifiers, not machine paths.
9. Run `scripts/check_sources.py` after source-registry edits. The script reports issues only and must not rewrite registry files.
10. Run `scripts/check_path_privacy.py` before finalizing CCFA-family changes that touch docs, examples, source records, scripts, diagrams, or release files.

## Output Contract

When auditing or updating CCFA skills, report:

```text
Routing impact:
Handoff mode impact:
Private-material safety:
Source-registry changes:
Score-risk language changes:
Validation result:
```
